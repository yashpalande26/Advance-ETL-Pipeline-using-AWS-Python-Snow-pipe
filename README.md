# Advance-ETL-Pipeline-using-AWS-Python-Snow-pipe:

In this innovative project, I made an end-to-end ETL pipeline to cater to a passionate client's quest for music insights and creation. Leveraging the Spotify API, I automated the weekly retrieval of top global songs data, ensuring up-to-date Billboard information. The ETL process was organize through AWS Lambda and CloudWatch(trigger), guaranteeing seamless data extraction, transformation, and loading into an S3 bucket. 

Notably, data transformation was completely automated, enhancing efficiency. The transformed data was then seamlessly loaded into Snowflake Data Warehouse using Snowpipe, achieving a fully automated ETL workflow. This project showcases my proficiency in ETL automation, and a keen interest in the data engineering
